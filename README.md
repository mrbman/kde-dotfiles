[KDE] [Bismuth]

* Left and Right Panel: Latte-Dock
* Middle Panel: Polybar
* Global Theme: Layan
* Tiling: Bismuth
* Terminal: Kitty
* Icons: Qogir-dark
* Music Player: Spotify_player

Limitation for polybar on KDE is that the wallpaper needs to be set via feh, and changing the wallpaper does not update the polybar transparent background.
Script to set this is added to 'start-polybar.sh'
